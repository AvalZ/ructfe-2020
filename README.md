# RuCTFE 2020

[RuCTFE](https://ructfe.org) is an annual online international challenge in the information security.

The contest is driven by classic rules (Attack-Defense [CTF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag#Computer_security)). Each team is given a set of vulnerable services. Organizers regulary fill services with private information â€” the flags. The goal of each team is to find vulnerabilities, fix them in their services and exploit them in order to get flags from other teams.

RuCTFE 2020 was held on December 26, 2020.
